###  :ramen: SQL_challenge

This is the famous [eight-week SQL challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) created by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/), in which your mission is to explore the database and answer questions from hypothetical clients.

### :dragon: D&D_bestiary

This is me having fun with a [database on D&D creatures](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrpantherson/dnd-5e-monsters) I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Some questions pop up as I explore, and through cleaning, filtering and data visualization, I hope I can find the answers.
